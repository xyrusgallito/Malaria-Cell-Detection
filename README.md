# Malaria-Cell-Detection
Creating an algorithm to automatically detect malaria from cell images using ML and DL models

Malaria, a febrile illness caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted through mosquito bites, poses a significant global health concern as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). In their worldwide malaria report for 2021, the WHO documented over 240 million cases of malaria in 2020. The impact of this rise in malaria cases is particularly severe in developing nations, where healthcare systems often face overwhelming challenges (Murray & Bennett, 2009).

To address these challenges and expedite malaria detection, the healthcare sector can leverage the potential of advanced deep learning algorithms and machine learning techniques. By harnessing the power of these cutting-edge technologies, it becomes possible to enhance the speed and accuracy of malaria diagnosis.
